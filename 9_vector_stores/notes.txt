in order to find similarity between 2 objects we use vector store 
it tells which 2 objects are have more similarity score 
it first convert object into embeddings and compare all the dimesions by calculating cosing similarity 


1. Generate embedding vectors 
2. Store embedding vectors (use vector DB not relational DB)
3. Intelligent Semantic Search 

All this can be done using vector store 
Feature of Vector Store 
1. Storage: of vectors and metadata 
2. Similarity Search : FInd most similar object/vector 
3. Indexing: fast similarity Search 
4. CRUD operations 


Vector Store vs Vector Database 
Store: has both storage and retrivers , FAISS is a vector store 
database: has distributed architecture, backups, concurrency control, auths, Pinecone, Milvus is a database 


Chroma DB: 
is a vector DB 
also light weight
