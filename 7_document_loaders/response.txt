Best thing ever. Seriously.

In love with this laptop. Laptop is of very high quality in my opinion. Its not flimsy and I think the price was just right for what it is. The design isn't bulky. The battery life depending on what you are doing last pretty long. Gives plenty of warning when running low and even tells you based on what is running how much time till it will power down if not connected to the wall. It is really quiet even when the fans are running at performance and the silent mode makes it seem like the fans aren't on at all. I have not had this laptop freeze or overheat so far! The speed is insane compared to my other laptop that is only a few years older.

Oh my god YES PLEASE AMAZING
Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2025Style: RTX4060 | 1TBVerified Purchase
Oh my god best purchase of my entire lifeI've never had a legit gaming laptop so there's so much I haven't been able to actually do. This one does it.The value is 100% worth the money, the performance is fantastic, it doesn't even get that hot.A good example for games are Sims 4. I've never truly got to play it due to it taking forever to load, and then I couldn't even do anything when I got into it. With this laptop, it took less than an hour to download all 50 packs (my old computer took TWO DAYS), and takes a second to open it and get me to the house.I so far have Sims, Sims 2 (and all packs), Sims 4 (and 50 packs), and House Flipper and it has no issues. Please please PLEASE get this laptop! It's so worth the price!!!

G16 review from a first time PC gamer
Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2025Style: RTX4060 | 1TBVerified Purchase
I picked this labtop because I wanted to have more variety of games that I can play. I also wanted a laptop that can help launch my A.I projects. Evertime I load up this computer, I feel like I'm transported to another world.A world of vibrant colors and intense graphics. As a console gamer of 20+ years, I definitely feel the difference  , and can see why PC gamers refer to themselves as "the PC master race." As a fighting game nerd, the 165hz makes it easier to react to those slower moves that you can barely react to with a console that's locked at 60hz. This labtop has the personality of an advanced A.I sent from the future. I wonder what the XG27UCS is like?

NOT 16 inches
Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2025Style: RTX4060 | 1TBVerified Purchase
My sister and I were both getting new laptops and my sister chose this one. Right off the bat we noticed how much smaller it was than anticipated. For reference, I previously had a 15inch computer and quickly saw this looked much smaller and I was correct.We measured and it’s approx 13.5 inches with an active screen of about 13inches.This was really important since we needed laptops that would fully utilize the cintiq 16 aspect ratio and laptops of a smaller size usually results in a smaller working area on the tablet.My sister still wanted to try and see if 13 inches would be enough and sadly it was not. It’s a big shame too because the laptop seems very well made. I’ve had an ASUS in the past and it lasted me a while so I trust the manufacturer. The silent fans really ARE very silent. The quietest laptop we’ve ever seen. The logo sound is a bit of a jumpscare when turning on the laptop though (it’s the sound of two blades), but I’m sure there’s a way you can turn that off if you’d like. We didn’t get past the set up since we just wanted to see if it was compatible with the Cintiq.Making this review so that other people know about the incorrect size listing. If you don’t mind getting a laptop that’s three inches smaller than anticipated then this seems like a good choice. If size does in fact matter to you then please look elsewhere. But also keep in mind, this isn’t the only wrong size listing. The Acer 17 laptop I got was in fact 15 inches despite the description. 15 at least uses the full Cintiq work area so I didn’t need to return mine but again it’s weird that you have to assume that what’s listed in the description is going to be off by two to three inches. This is, technically, false advertising.

Received the laptop and it both looks great and works amazingly. I have only downloaded a few of my games to it but the few I did download look amazing! Loads pretty quickly and things look and run so smoothly! This is my first decently priced laptop so I my view may be skewed but I am loving my purchase so far.

Excelente laptop para gaming y trabajo pesado!La compré hace poco y hasta ahora ha superado mis expectativas. La pantalla de 165 Hz se ve increíble, muy fluida, y el rendimiento con la tarjeta gráfica RTX 4060 y el procesador i7-13650HX es espectacular. He probado varios juegos exigentes y todo corre sin problemas. Además, el diseño RGB del teclado le da un toque muy atractivo. Muy recomendada para gamers y creadores de contenido.

Dim screen
Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2025Style: RTX4060 | 1TBVerified Purchase
Great laptop! Runs games very well there’s just a couple of things that irk me. One is it runs VERY hot, you definitely need to get a cooling pad or something if you plan on laying down or anything of that sort. Second issue, and this is the big one, the screen is not bright AT ALL. Very dim even on max brightness settings. Other than that, it has ran great and handles everything I’ve thrown at it.

Reviews with imagesSee all photosPrevious pageNext pageAll photosAmazon Customer5 out of 5 starsLaptop Review – First ImpressionsI received my new laptop today and wanted to share my initial thoughts. **Delivery & Packaging:** - The laptop arrived **on time**, which was great. - The packaging was **decent**, though I noticed there wasn’t much protection for the screen—if something were to fall on that side, it could be a concern. - Opening the packaging was **simple and hassle-free**, making the unboxing experience smooth. - **Removing the laptop** from the packaging was effortless. **First Impressions & Performance:** - I was **pleasantly surprised** when the LED lighting turned on—it was a nice touch! - The laptop **works as intended**—no issues booting up, and everything was pre-installed as expected. I’ll continue using it and update this review after more extensive use. So far, things are looking good!

In love with this laptop. Laptop is of very high quality in my opinion. Its not flimsy and I think the price was just right for what it is. The design isn't bulky. The battery life depending on what you are doing last pretty long. Gives plenty of warning when running low and even tells you based on what is running how much time till it will power down if not connected to the wall. It is really quiet even when the fans are running at performance and the silent mode makes it seem like the fans aren't on at all. I have not had this laptop freeze or overheat so far! The speed is insane compared to my other laptop that is only a few years older.

Laptop Review – First Impressions
Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2025Style: RTX4060 | 1TBVerified Purchase
I received my new laptop today and wanted to share my initial thoughts.**Delivery & Packaging:**- The laptop arrived **on time**, which was great.- The packaging was **decent**, though I noticed there wasn’t much protection for the screen—if something were to fall on that side, it could be a concern.- Opening the packaging was **simple and hassle-free**, making the unboxing experience smooth.- **Removing the laptop** from the packaging was effortless.**First Impressions & Performance:**- I was **pleasantly surprised** when the LED lighting turned on—it was a nice touch!- The laptop **works as intended**—no issues booting up, and everything was pre-installed as expected.I’ll continue using it and update this review after more extensive use. So far, things are looking good!Adrian

Oh my god YES PLEASE AMAZING
Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2025Style: RTX4060 | 1TBVerified Purchase
Oh my god best purchase of my entire lifeI've never had a legit gaming laptop so there's so much I haven't been able to actually do. This one does it.The value is 100% worth the money, the performance is fantastic, it doesn't even get that hot.A good example for games are Sims 4. I've never truly got to play it due to it taking forever to load, and then I couldn't even do anything when I got into it. With this laptop, it took less than an hour to download all 50 packs (my old computer took TWO DAYS), and takes a second to open it and get me to the house.I so far have Sims, Sims 2 (and all packs), Sims 4 (and 50 packs), and House Flipper and it has no issues. Please please PLEASE get this laptop! It's so worth the price!!!

G16 review from a first time PC gamer
Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2025Style: RTX4060 | 1TBVerified Purchase
I picked this labtop because I wanted to have more variety of games that I can play. I also wanted a laptop that can help launch my A.I projects. Evertime I load up this computer, I feel like I'm transported to another world.A world of vibrant colors and intense graphics. As a console gamer of 20+ years, I definitely feel the difference  , and can see why PC gamers refer to themselves as "the PC master race." As a fighting game nerd, the 165hz makes it easier to react to those slower moves that you can barely react to with a console that's locked at 60hz. This labtop has the personality of an advanced A.I sent from the future. I wonder what the XG27UCS is like?

NOT 16 inches
Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2025Style: RTX4060 | 1TBVerified Purchase
My sister and I were both getting new laptops and my sister chose this one. Right off the bat we noticed how much smaller it was than anticipated. For reference, I previously had a 15inch computer and quickly saw this looked much smaller and I was correct.We measured and it’s approx 13.5 inches with an active screen of about 13inches.This was really important since we needed laptops that would fully utilize the cintiq 16 aspect ratio and laptops of a smaller size usually results in a smaller working area on the tablet.My sister still wanted to try and see if 13 inches would be enough and sadly it was not. It’s a big shame too because the laptop seems very well made. I’ve had an ASUS in the past and it lasted me a while so I trust the manufacturer. The silent fans really ARE very silent. The quietest laptop we’ve ever seen. The logo sound is a bit of a jumpscare when turning on the laptop though (it’s the sound of two blades), but I’m sure there’s a way you can turn that off if you’d like. We didn’t get past the set up since we just wanted to see if it was compatible with the Cintiq.Making this review so that other people know about the incorrect size listing. If you don’t mind getting a laptop that’s three inches smaller than anticipated then this seems like a good choice. If size does in fact matter to you then please look elsewhere. But also keep in mind, this isn’t the only wrong size listing. The Acer 17 laptop I got was in fact 15 inches despite the description. 15 at least uses the full Cintiq work area so I didn’t need to return mine but again it’s weird that you have to assume that what’s listed in the description is going to be off by two to three inches. This is, technically, false advertising.

Smooth graphics and good frames per second.
Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2025Style: RTX4060 | 1TBVerified Purchase
Received the laptop and it both looks great and works amazingly. I have only downloaded a few of my games to it but the few I did download look amazing! Loads pretty quickly and things look and run so smoothly! This is my first decently priced laptop so I my view may be skewed but I am loving my purchase so far.

Rendimiento y diseño de primera
Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2025Style: RTX4060 | 1TBVerified Purchase
Excelente laptop para gaming y trabajo pesado!La compré hace poco y hasta ahora ha superado mis expectativas. La pantalla de 165 Hz se ve increíble, muy fluida, y el rendimiento con la tarjeta gráfica RTX 4060 y el procesador i7-13650HX es espectacular. He probado varios juegos exigentes y todo corre sin problemas. Además, el diseño RGB del teclado le da un toque muy atractivo. Muy recomendada para gamers y creadores de contenido.

Dim screen
Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2025Style: RTX4060 | 1TBVerified Purchase
Great laptop! Runs games very well there’s just a couple of things that irk me. One is it runs VERY hot, you definitely need to get a cooling pad or something if you plan on laying down or anything of that sort. Second issue, and this is the big one, the screen is not bright AT ALL. Very dim even on max brightness settings. Other than that, it has ran great and handles everything I’ve thrown at it.
